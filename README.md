# Sokoban-Game (Java) | Co-developed
One-player Sokoban-style puzzle game built in Java, focused on strategic movement, collision detection, and modular game design.

Features:

- Implemented keyboard controls (arrow keys) for player movement: up, down, left, right. No diagonal movement.

- Collision detection ensures players cannot walk into walls.

- Crates and trophies can only be pushed up, down, or left/right; once they fall into holes, they are permanently lost.

- Strategic movement mechanics to solve puzzles efficiently.

- Structured game logic using visitor patterns, utility classes, and function objects for modularity.



How to Play:

- Use arrow keys to move the player in the four cardinal directions.

- Avoid falling into holes; any object (including the player) that falls into a hole is permanently lost.

- Move crates and trophies to solve puzzles — they cannot be moved diagonally.

- No undo/redo option available; each move is final.

- Designed as a single-player game.
